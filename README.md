This is a simple, one-page portfolio built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Start the Dev Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Update the Portfolio Items

You can update your about section and portfolio items from the `pages/index.js` file.

## Replace the Images

Change and update the images in the `public` folder. You'll also need to update your profile and logo image paths in the about section and portfolio items.

Use this [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/EEOhLx4ydkv1wbYclJ3MhJ/Image-Templates?node-id=0%3A1) as a template for your images. You can use the Favicon Generator(https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) to convert the favicon to all the appropriate files.

## Update the Default SEO

Update the SEO for your portfolio from the `pages/_app.js` file. Be sure to replace the `https://hunterbecton.com/social.jpg` with your final domain and file path.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
